This project contains a collection of fun exercises implemented in Java. It serves as a training ground for practicing various programming concepts and solving coding challenges.

## About the Project

As a student with a background in front-end development, this repository showcases my journey in learning and exploring the Java programming language. The exercises presented here are meant to improve my Java skills and reinforce important programming concepts.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `src/`: Contains the source code files for the exercises.
- `test/`: Includes test files to validate the correctness of the implementations using JUnit.

## Getting Started

To run and test the exercises, you will need:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

Follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Navigate to the exercise you want to explore in the `src/` directory.
4. Run the exercise's main method or corresponding test cases to observe the output and verify its correctness.
